# Factors-Affecting-Infant-Sleep-Patterns

## Description

This project aims to analyze the sleep patterns and factors affecting sleep duration and awakenings in infants. The dataset used for this analysis includes information on various variables such as maternal mental health, infant age, sleep environment, and sleep behaviors.

## Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
- Factor Analysis to identify underlying factors related to sleep patterns.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
- Statistical tests (ANOVA) to evaluate the significance of differences in sleep patterns across groups.
- Data visualization to illustrate the findings and insights.
